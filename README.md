### QUIZ FOR POTENTIAL DEVELOPERS
To determine current skill level -
Send your responses to rolemodelenterprises@gmail.com 

Refer to http://github.com/ece106/tomatocan and use tutorials, Google, etc. to help you figure out the answers. 

1. What is the design of the Tomatocan database? Submit as a jpg or png (You may draw on paper & submit as a photo).
Database used for Tomatocan is sqlite3. Below is the screen shot of database of Tomatocan.
sqlite> .databases
seq  name             file
---  ---------------  ----------------------------------------------------------
0    main
sqlite>

2. Which file/view is the users' home page? What information do authors get to display on their home page? Where is this information stored in the Tomatocan database?

3. What pages/views do authors get in their web site when they sign up for Tomatocan?

4. What are the default views for all Rails apps?

5. What are the routes that were added to the Tomatocan app so the non-default/extra views for user pages could be displayed?

6. What are the methods that were added to the Tomatocan app so the non-default/extra user views/pages could be displayed? What file are they in?

7. Where is the method to add_bank_account to users? What gem does it use?

8. Fork a copy of the tomatocan github repo (url above) into your GitHub account. Make a minor change that does not affect functionality (such as add a dummy file to the root directory) and request that the Tomatocan admin pull your changes.

9. Summarize your Ruby & Rails skill level/what you know in your own words.

When you have completed the quiz, download and start working on the tutorial at https://github.com/ece106/tomatocan/blob/master/public/LearnRailsIn2Minutes.odt 

### TO USE THE TOMATOCAN GITHUB

For a list of helpful git commands use the git cheetsheet: https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/

1. Forking from tomatocan and bringing the code to your local machine

Begin by forking the tomatocan code by pressing the fork button located at http://github.com/ece106/tomatocan. Forking will allow you to have a copy of the tomatocan code in your personal github and will give you a way to request tomatocan to pull your changes. 

In order to bring the tomatocan code to your local machine you must make a clone of the fork you have created. 

a. On GitHub, navigate to your fork of the tomatocan repository.

b. Under the repository name, click ``` Clone or download ```.

c. Open a commandline in the location you would like your code to be saved and use the command:

```
 git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB_USERNAME/tomatocan
```

2. Saving your changes to your repository

In order to push your code to your repository you will have to stage your files to commit. You can stage your files by using the following commands:

"Adds modified and new files that are not .ignored to the stage"
```
git add * :/
```

To finish your commit (which will save your current files) use the command:
```
git commit -a -m "Useful Comment of Your Changes/Additions"
```

Now you can push your comitted changes to your repository with the following commands:

```
git push origin master
```
or

```
git push https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR-TOMATOCAN-REPOSITORY master
```

3. Pulling changes from tomatocan into your local machine

When changes have been made to the code http://github.com/ece106/tomatocan, your github will be behind. So you will have to pull the changes to your local machine and then push them to your repository. To pull changes from tomatocan, be sure to be in the correct directory, and use the command: 

```
git pull https://github.com/ece106/tomatocan.git master
```

4. Getting your code onto tomatocan

Once you have made changes to your personal repository you can request for tomatocan to pull your changes into the original repository. To do this you have to create a pull request. One way of creating a pull request is to go to http:/github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/YOUR-TOMATOCAN-REPOSITORY and there is a button labeled "New Pull Request". After creating a pull request your changes have to be reviewed and then either accepted or denied.

### TO USE THE CODE IN YOUR LOCAL TEST ENVIRONMENT

Files To Check/Change/Create: 

* gemfile: 
    Comment out 
```
    #gem 'pg' 
```
and uncomment 
```
gem 'sqlite3'
```

* config/initializers/aakeys.rb: 
    Create this file DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME (note that it is listed in .gitignore) & paste the following into it:

```
DEVISE_SECRET_KEY = 'fake'
AWS_KEY = 'morefake'
AWS_SECRET_KEY = 'pretend' 
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "madeup"
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = "allfake"
GMAIL_PWD = "superfake"
Stripe.api_key = STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
STRIPE_CONNECT_CLIENT_ID = "superfake"
```

Of course, with the fake keys, you will not be able to use AWS (upload files to user profiles), Devise (logins), or Stripe (purchase items from authors). If you have your own AWS, Devise, or Stripe accounts, you may replace the keys in config/initializers/aakeys.rb with your accounts' keys. 

*config/database.yml

Create this file DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME (note that it is listed in .gitignore) & paste the following into it:

```
default: &default
  adapter: sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

development:
  <<: *default
  database: db/development.sqlite3

test:
  <<: *default
  database: db/test.sqlite3
```

* config/environments/development.rb: 

Create this file DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME (note that it is listed in .gitignore) & paste the following into it:

```
Rails.application.configure do

config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = true
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
  :address => "smtp.gmail.com",
  :port => 587,
  :user_name => "randomemail@gmail.com",
  :password => 'fake',
  :authentication => 'plain',
  :enable_starttls_auto => true
}
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = {
  host: "localhost:3000", protocol: "http" 
}
  config.cache_classes = false
  config.eager_load = false
  config.consider_all_requests_local = true

  if Rails.root.join('tmp/caching-dev.txt').exist?
    config.action_controller.perform_caching = true

    config.cache_store = :memory_store
    config.public_file_server.headers = {
      'Cache-Control' => "public, max-age=#{2.days.seconds.to_i}"
    }
  else
    config.action_controller.perform_caching = false
    config.cache_store = :null_store
  end

  config.active_support.deprecation = :log
  config.active_record.migration_error = :page_load
  config.assets.debug = true
  config.assets.quiet = true
  config.file_watcher = ActiveSupport::EventedFileUpdateChecker
end
```

Then type
```
>bundle install
```
at the command line to install all the necessary gems.

Then type
```
>rake db:migrate
```
at the command line to build the database with the correct schema.

Then type
```
>bin/rails server
```
at the command line to start the server.
